This repository contains a VHDL counter with a subtle bug related to overflow handling and its corrected version.  The `buggy_counter.vhdl` file demonstrates the flawed implementation. The `fixed_counter.vhdl` file presents the corrected code with improved boundary condition handling.  The bug is a potential for an unexpected value if the counter reaches its maximum value and then overflows. The solution addresses this by properly resetting the counter to zero when the maximum value is reached.
